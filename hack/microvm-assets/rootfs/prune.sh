# Purge every Debian package the guest does not need, in the rootfs stage of
# Dockerfile, after the guest's packages are installed and while the apt lists are
# still present.
#
# Usage: prune.sh <package>...   (the packages the guest runs)
#
# The guest executes kata-agent and the handful of tools named on the command line,
# nothing else, and it never runs a package manager. So the keep set is those
# packages, the few below that every image needs, and their Depends/Pre-Depends
# closure. apt works the closure out, not this script: a simulated install of the keep
# set into an empty system lists exactly what it pulls in. Everything installed
# outside it is purged, Essential packages included (perl, util-linux, apt itself...).
#
# dpkg removes the files, so no path in the image is named here, and its database
# still lists exactly what is left, which keeps the image queryable with dpkg and
# scannable by the tools that read /var/lib/dpkg/status. The purged packages'
# prerm/postrm scripts are dropped first: they tidy up debconf, alternatives and
# users on a system that will never run dpkg again, and they call the tools
# (perl, sed, find) this same purge removes, so there is no order that runs them all.
